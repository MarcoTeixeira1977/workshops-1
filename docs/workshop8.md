# Experiences in implementing pan-European Services using national INSPIRE services

A workshop on sharing our experiences in implementing pan-European Services using national INSPIRE services, with a particular focus on lesson learned. Based on our ELF, ELS and CRD experiences we have learned a lot, and it would be of interest to others if we take the opportunity to share these more widely. Key partners in pan-European projects will present the lessons learned.
