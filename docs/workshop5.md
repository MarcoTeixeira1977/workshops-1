# Feel the power of INSPIRE WCS / WCPS in your hands

This hands-on workshop will focus on exploring the advantages of using coverages through the OGC standards WCS / WCPS and SOS when accessing, subsetting, and combining INSPIRE coverage data sources, e.g.: 
- Data belonging to INSPIRE coverage themes - where coverages are considered as features (WCS view): Energy resources (ER), Natural risk zones (NZ), Elevation (EL), Land cover (LC), Land use (LU), Orthoimagery (OI), Soil (SO) & Geology (GE). 
- Data belonging to INSPIRE Observations & Measurements (O&M) Themes - with coverage data seen as observation results (SOS view): Environmental monitoring facilities (EF), Atmospheric conditions & Meteorological geographical features (AC/MF), Oceanographic geographical features (OF) & Geology (GE). 
- Other INSPIRE and/or external data layers, such as Copernicus data. 
 
The proposed workshop will be structured according to the following approximate schema: 

a) State of Play about coverage data and WCS / WCPS services standardisation in OGC / ISO, including the new OGC OpenAPI - Coverages interface. 

b) State of Play of INSPIRE Coverages - OGC Compliant INSPIRE XSD coverage schemas. 

c) Practical WCS / WCPS exercise: 
- Introduction to the use of rasdaman engine. 
- Practical geospatial data exercise. 
- Importing and re-using existing WCS services available. 
- Analyse and combine different data layers mostly based on WCS sources. 
- Download and presentation of results. 
- Feedback from the audience. 

d) Conclusions for the future and the evolution of INSPIRE coverages. 
 
The practical exercise proposed as the central task of this workshop will allow the audience to experience the potential of these technologies and fully-understand the main benefits of integrating them within their daily geospatial businesses and analytical tasks. 
 
All practical examples and documentation part of this workshop will be published in the INSPIRE Community Forum ([https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/forum/](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/forum/)), together with a comprehensive overview of the outcomes of this activity. 
 
In conclusion, this activity constitutes a unique opportunity to boost coverage data and services use by the INSPIRE community at large, focusing on the key benefits delivered to all stakeholders involved.

# Requirements for participants

The workshop is targeted to both, users and providers of any kind of geospatial raster data. 
 
Pre-workshop preparation - It would be desirable if attendees could: 
 
a) Familiarise with the basics of coverages by reading the tutorials at [http://www.earthserver.eu/webinars](http://www.earthserver.eu/webinars) and the discussions about INSPIRE coverages in the [INSPIRE Community Forum](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/forum/). 
 
b) Collect open issues within their organisations for discussion, analysis and clarification.
