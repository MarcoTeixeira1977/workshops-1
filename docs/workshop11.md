# Automating cloud delivery of spatial data

Spatineo presents a case where INSPIRE Planned Land Use data was published in the cloud using GeoServer and automation tools. This work was part of a major venture by the Ministry of
Environment to digitize land use plans. In a pilot project, land use data was collected from municipalities into the National Geospatial Platform in a draft national format. The data was the
published on AWS as INSPIRE data using a novel automated workflow that allowed easy deployment of configuration and data updates in a robust and scalable fashion.
