# Event-Driven INSPIRE

Many applications rely on the timely delivery of data. This can comprise: 
 
- Monitoring applications, which continuously check certain environmental parameters (e.g. air quality) or risks (e.g. flooding risk based on water level measurements). 
 
- Mapping applications of dynamic properties (e.g. radar images, flight/ship tracking) 
 
- Complex analysis workflows which require up-to-date satellite imagery as input 
 
- Catalogue clients that shall notify users about new available data sets or updates to existing data sets 
 
However, the existing INSPIRE approaches for data delivery are based on pull-style communication. That means that clients connect to servers and check if new data is available. With new communication protocols and specifications that are currently becoming available, push/event-based data delivery becomes a new option. 
 
This promises two important benefits: 
 
a) Faster delivery of information: With a push-based communication pattern the delivery of data can happen as soon as new data sets are available. 
 
b) Reduction of server and network load: Currently, clients have to regularly query servers to check if new or updated data is available. If new data is directly delivered as soon as it is available, the server load created by continuously polling clients can be avoided. 
 
Within this workshop we would like to provide an introduction into technologies and standards (e.g. MQTT, AMQP, OGC Publish/Subscribe, OGC SensorThings API) that may help to enable event-driven communication patterns within INSPIRE. Besides introductory presentations, this will also comprise demonstrations of practical applications (e.g. the German research project WaCoDiS) and potentially hands-on experiences with selected technologies (e.g. accessing near real-time data streams delivered through MQTT brokers).

# Requirements for participants

There are no specific requirements. Generally an understanding of Spatial Data Infrastructures and an interest in new technologies will be helpful. For trying out technology demos, participants should bring their laptop.
